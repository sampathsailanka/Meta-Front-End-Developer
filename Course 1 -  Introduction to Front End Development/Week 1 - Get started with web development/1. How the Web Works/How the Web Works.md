A web server is a computer program or software that serves as the foundation for delivering web content across the Internet. It handles the request-response cycle, allowing clients (web browsers) to access and view web pages, files, and other resources.

Here's a high-level overview of how a web server works:


<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Client sends a request:</b> When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in your web browser or click on a link, it sends a request to the web server. The request contains information such as the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), headers, and sometimes data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Server receives the request:</b> The web server software running on the server machine receives the incoming request. Common web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services), and Node.js (which is a runtime environment for JavaScript).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Processing the request:</b> The server processes the request based on the specified HTTP method and the requested resource. For example, if it's a GET request for a web page, the server retrieves the HTML file associated with that page.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Server-side processing:</b> If the requested resource involves server-side processing, such as running server-side scripts or interacting with a database, the web server passes the request to an appropriate component or module. For example, if the server is configured to handle PHP scripts, it passes the request to the PHP interpreter.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Generating the response:</b> Once the server has gathered all the necessary data, it generates an HTTP response. This response typically includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers (providing additional information about the response), and the content itself.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Sending the response:</b> The web server sends the response back to the client, typically over the HTTP protocol. The client, usually a web browser, receives the response.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Client-side rendering:</b> The client browser interprets the received response, processes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders the web page accordingly. The rendered page is then displayed to the user.
    </li>
</ol>



This process repeats for each request made by the client to the web server. Web servers can handle various types of requests, including serving static files (e.g., HTML, images, CSS), executing server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Python), handling API requests, and more.

Web servers are essential components of the World Wide Web, as they enable the distribution and accessibility of web content to users around the globe.

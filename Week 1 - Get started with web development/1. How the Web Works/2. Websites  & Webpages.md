# Webpages vs Websites

## Webpage
A webpage is a single document or file on the World Wide Web that can be accessed through a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). It is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and may contain additional resources like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Webpages are designed to be viewed by web browsers and can include text, images, multimedia, links, and other elements.

Webpages are the building blocks of websites and can exist independently. They can be simple, standalone documents or part of a larger website structure.

## Website
A website, on the other hand, is a collection of related webpages that are interconnected and share a common domain name. A website provides a cohesive online presence and is typically hosted on a web server. It often includes a homepage, which serves as the main entry point, and may have multiple sections or subpages.

A website can encompass various types of content, including informational pages, articles, blog posts, product listings, services, media galleries, contact forms, and more. It may also include navigation menus, search functionality, user authentication, and other features to enhance user experience and provide interactivity.

Websites are designed to serve a specific purpose, such as sharing information, promoting a business, selling products, providing services, or engaging users through various means. They can range from simple static websites with fixed content to dynamic websites with interactive elements and regularly updated information.

In summary, a webpage refers to an individual document or file on the web, while a website is a collection of interconnected webpages that form a cohesive online entity.

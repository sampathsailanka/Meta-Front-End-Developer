#Internet Protocols & HTTP

## Internet Protocol {IP}
Internet protocols are the foundation of communication on the Internet. They are a set of rules and standards that govern the exchange of information between devices connected to the Internet. These protocols define how data is transmitted, routed, and received, ensuring that devices can understand and interact with each other seamlessly.

The Internet Protocol Suite, commonly known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), is the most widely used set of protocols for communication over the Internet. It consists of several individual protocols, each serving a specific purpose within the overall framework.


## HTTP {Hyper Text Transfer Protocol}
HTTP is a core operational protocol of the world wide web. It is what enables your web browser to communicate with a web server that hosts a website. HTTP is the communication protocol you use whenever you browse the web. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used for transferring web resources such as HTML documents, images, styles, and other files. HTTP is a request response based protocol. A web browser or client sends an HTTP request to a server and the web server sends the HTTP response back to the browser. Next, let's start exploring the makeup of an HTTP request. An HTTP requests consists of a method, path, version and headers. The HTTP method describes the type of action that the client must performed. The primary or the most commonly used HTTP methods are, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server.
